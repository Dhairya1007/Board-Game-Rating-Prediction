# Board-Game-Rating-Prediction
This is a simple project to predict board game ratings based on the data of over 80,000 games. I have used both a linear regression model and a random forest regression model to do this task. 

Required Libraries :

Matplotlib <br>
Seaborn <br>
sklearn <br>
pandas

This model will output the rating of a particular game (out of 10) based on the past data on which it was trained. 

Data preprocessing : in data processing, i removed the unnecessary columns and also the columns which have zero rating.

Credits - Thanks to Brennan and Eduonix for the awesome course which helped me.
